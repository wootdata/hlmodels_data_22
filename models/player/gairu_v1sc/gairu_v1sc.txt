GAIRU for Half-Life
.------------------.


Author: skrwX

triangles: under 500

features:
	 -can change colors within the COSTUMIZE menu

	 -has a chrome texture

	 -it's made by myself

Well, this is my first HL-model and I think it's not too bad so I thought:
Let's post it to the people of COLDFUSION. It looks that ugly because
it uses few triangles and it uses only a few of them because I have a
slow computer and wanted to have a DM-model I could play with.


end of readme.
